SMW
========

Just some global functions I find useful sometimes. 
Also I wanted to practice making a cocoapod.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

SMW is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "SMW"
